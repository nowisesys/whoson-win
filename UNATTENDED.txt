The application can be installed in unattended mode, bypassing the license 
agreement and using default options.

  msiexec /quiet /i setup.exe          # background
  msiexec /passive /qb /i setup.exe    # visible

In either mode, the DOS-window will popup when the whoson application is 
runned with the -r option to register the eventlog source.
